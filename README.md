# Code Haven

This project will provide easy compilation and execution, Generally, developers need to write programs for 
different languages for different purposes and need to compile as well as execute them. The solution to their 
requirement is a Web Based IDE. 
The project will be deployed to the web site and all users can access it through the internet. The online IDE which 
we have made is based on an API, due to which less storage is required on the server side, The text editor which 
we have used has syntax highlighting which makes coding easy and fast.
